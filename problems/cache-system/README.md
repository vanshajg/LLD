# Problem statement

We have to do a low level design for cache system. It should support the following operations:
1. PUT: This would allow user to insert the value against a key
2. GET: This would allow user to get the value against a key
3. Eviction: Cache should also support the removal of some key if the cache is full when we try to insert a new value.
